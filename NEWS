firsttable 0.1.2 (2018-05-23)
-----------------------------

* Added more examples

firsttable 0.1.1 (2018-05-19)
-----------------------------

* include_row_n now correct where there is missing column data
* All first_table options now passed to row functions to allow for better
  use of options where not explicitly overridden for a row.

firsttable 0.1.0 (2018-05-18)
-----------------------------

* First version of package being readied for wider release
* Changes syntax for options to use a named list supplied as `.options` to
  reduce the risk of clashes between future options and row details. This
  also makes it easier to call the function multiple times with the same
  options. At present the old syntax is still supported (with a warning) but
  this may be removed in future.
* Also changes the names of the `data` and `column_variable` options to have a
  leading `.` for similar reasons.
