## Notes
Sorry for resubmitting in a short timespace - I realised there was an error
in the reporting of the row_n, and some inconsistency in the way table-wide
options applied to rows where they were not overridden.

## Test environments
* local Windows 7 install, R 3.5.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0, R-devel and 3.3.3
* win-builder (R-release and R-devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs (other than it being a new submission).

## Downstream dependencies
None at this time
